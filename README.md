### Console++

This extension proves a quick and easy way to install Console++

By default, the TTS Console++ Panel will only show messages and errors from Tabletop, to enable further interaction you need to install  [Console++](https://github.com/onelivesleft/Console) along with a modified version that listens on `customMessages`.

Bring up the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and look up:

​`>TTSLua: Install Console++`

If successful you should see a notification near the bottom right letting you know so.

Finally activate the scripts by including them in your Global scope:

`require("vscode/console")`

Save and Play (`Ctrl+Alt+S`) And you can now use the input textbox at the bottom of the Console++ Panel that will send commands to the game directly from VSCode. Prefixing these messages with `>` will send your input as a command for Console++.

[Here is a tutorial series on how to use Console++](http://blog.onelivesleft.com/2017/09/debugging-your-tts-mods-with-console.html)

You can also choose to not prefix a command and be able to catch them in TTS like this:

```lua
function onExternalCommand(input)
  -- input contains the string you entered from VS Code
  print('VSCode: ' .. input)
end
```

### Nested File Feature

This extension, similar to the official Atom Plugin, allows developers to structure their scripts among several files, the way of doing so is with the following statements:

- `require("<FILE>")` for Lua
- `<Include src="<FILE>"/>` for XML

###### Replacing `<File>` for the filename you wish to retrieve, also works for absolute paths

Theres an ordered priority list from which these files will be looked up from, stopping at the first match:

1. Documents Folder: `~/Documents/Tabletop Simulator`
2. Folders described in `TTSLua.includeOtherFilesPaths` setting
3. Folders currently opened in the workspace

And specifically for Lua, the `TTSLua.searchBundlePattern` setting allows modification of the lookup pattern. The extension will look for files ending with `.ttslua` and `.lua` by default.

## Commands

Commands can be triggered either by hotkey or via the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)

| Command                         | Description                                                                                                                                           | Hotkey          |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Open TTS Console++              | This command will open the Console++ Panel in VSCode to the side, where you'll find messages sent from the game and be able to send your own commands | ``Ctrl+Alt+` `` |
| Get Lua Scripts                 | Once confirmed, this will pull all scripts from the game to the editor                                                                                | `Ctrl+Alt+L`    |
| Save And Play                   | This will save all currently modified files and then push them to be executed on the game                                                             | `Ctrl+Alt+S`    |
| Install Console++               | This is the automated install, once finished you'll be able to require Console++ in your scripts like so `require('vscode/console')`                  | Palette Only    |
| Add include folder to workspace | Use this command to quickly add the default include folder to your workspace (`~/Documents/Tabletop Simulator`)                                       | Palette Only    |

## Known Issues

###### In order from most difficult to least difficult to fix

1. Console panel sometimes displays print messages out of order.
2. Line numbers on error are mismatched when using `require()`.
3. Execute Lua Code is not supported.
4. Command Input has no history. (`Arrow Up`)
5. Partial theme support. Needs more testing.

## About

This project was motivated on trying out different solutions to communicate VSCode with TTS and being rather unsuccessful at that. I tried using [OliPro007's Extension](https://github.com/OliPro007/tabletopsimulator-lua-vscode) and was a bit finicky for me, I also checked out [dustinlacewell's vatts](https://github.com/dustinlacewell/vatts) and was able to retrieve scripts but not send them. I guess I'm just inexperienced setting up these extensions which is why I wanted to dive into it by making my own and hoped to streamline the process for someone else.

I kind of ended up doing my own thing.
